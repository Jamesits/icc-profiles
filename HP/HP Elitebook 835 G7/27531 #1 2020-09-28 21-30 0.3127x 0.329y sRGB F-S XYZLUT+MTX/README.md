HP Elitebook 835 G7 (惠普 战X) internal screen, eDP, matte

The calibration data is completely wrong because of the default-enabled Vari-Bright feature. 

Settings:

* Brightness: 100
* Change brightness automatically when lighting changes: off
* Vari-Bright: on (must install AMD display driver to disable it)

Calibrated at 2020-09-28.
